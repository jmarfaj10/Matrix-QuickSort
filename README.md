# Matrix-QuickSort
Sorting a matrix with quicksort algorithm

This is a project which I was coding in the second year of my degree.

#Class Location

it has two variables (x and y) represents the position it occupies in the matrix. The location class allows us treat the matrix as a vector, it has two important methods:
- incr(this method increase 1 position the location of the element)
- decr(this method decrease 1 position the location of the element)
- compareLocations(this method compare two location and return if they have the same value or not)

# Class MatrixQuickSort

Runs the quicksort algorithm using objects of type Location on an matrix of integers
